# PHP MVC framework with complete operation CRUD for user login, logout, profile edit, delete, regestration with MySqli database.

The project is for developing a custom routing based framework where we design CRUD operation using MySqli and controlling users to manually getting inside our server root folders.


## Usage/Examples

At terms of using this framework in real life cpanel or any hosting make sure to change url and API.
There is a file called define.php where i set :
#define('url','https://localhost/MVC')

Just remember i designed whole process in my own local server using Apache. 
In real life you are going to use a hosting may be cpanel.
Copy everything inside MVC and paste to your root directory public_html.

Than change the urls like #define('url','https://www/something.com');

Just dont use MVC anywhere cause you are not going to put MVC folder inside root, you are just copying everything inside MVC and paste in public_html root.

Also all other url such as in button or navbar change them to your ip such as https://www.something.com insted of https://localhost/MVC .

Any further ques you can ask me in my mail arnobsamin95@gmail.com

## Environment Variables

Change every url where you see :
https://localhost/MVC/... to https://www.something.com/...


## Optimizations

I made sure the operation was good enough to demonstrate CRUD operation for a PHP MVC framework.

But, I didn't tried much to make complete responsive css design beside the bootstrap. So make sure to optimize it further for 4k designs.

Also you can set up more better regex condition for user regestration form to take values and apply them as your need.
